**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The Gaming Room is an app developer responsible for creating the Android app Draw it or Lose It, based on the ‘80s game show Win, Lose or Draw. The client has approached Creative Technology Solutions to help them in porting their mobile app to a web-based application capable of running across devices and operating platforms. The game involves one or more uniquely named teams, each with multiple players. Game names must be unique and only one instance can run at the same time. Unique objects representing the game, team and players will be used to implement this requirement.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
The design constraints. I think I thought up a few good points for that list.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
Did we write code for this assignment? It's kind of a blur. I vaguely recall reading from a UML and using that, plus my programming experience, to build it out.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
Design contraints. I think it could use more constraints. The document could overall have more high-level technical details, but what can you do when it's an 8 week course?

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
The user's needs are arguably the most importing aspect to consider in design, followed closely by the client's needs (where the client and user aren't the same). I just used my design and UI/UX background to think from a user POV and operated on that basis to design the software.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
The UML is very useful, and quite easy to create. I'd definitely use that along with a detailed design doc.
